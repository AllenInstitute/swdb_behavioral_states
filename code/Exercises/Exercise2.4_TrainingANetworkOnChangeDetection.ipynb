    "    <p>To explore this question, let's make some dramatic simplictions.\n",
    "    <p> * There is a task Oracle which executes the task optimally and it is willing to share its instruction with our naive network (this transforms a temporally sparse credit assignment problem into a 'supervised' one).\n",
    "    <p> * Our network can be trained in batches (we do not need to execute online or bioplausible learning rules here).\n",
    "    <p> * Our network does not see images, but instead will see stimulus vectors (here each stimulus represents a different image) which are turned on in a 1-hot manner in flashes. \n",
    "    <p> * Our networks output is a single number which we can call the 'licking rate'. The network must learn to supress 'licks' until it sees a change in stimulus. In the way, it must store a working memory against which to compare which stimulus was presented last.\n",
    "    <p> * Our network can be trained efficiently using Recursive least Squares to map stimulus changes onto internal dynamics and ultimately an output.\n",
